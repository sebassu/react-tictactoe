# Tic-Tac-Toe
Basic two-player playable version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, with move revisiting features, implemented using React following [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). This version is the end result of the steps shown there, despite remaining some further additional steps that will (most possibly) be addressed in the near future.

### TODO:
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
1. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
1. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
1. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
1. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
1. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
